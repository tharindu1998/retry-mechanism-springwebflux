Microservices and other external dependencies are vulnerable to occasional failures brought on by temporary service outages, network problems, or temporary faults. These errors may only occur temporarily, and repeating the procedure again after a little break frequently results in a successful outcome. Retry mechanisms are designed to deal with these brief interruptions by repeatedly attempting to carry out a particular task until it completes or a predetermined number of retries are used up.
